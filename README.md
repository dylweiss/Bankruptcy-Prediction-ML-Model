The prediction of corporate bankruptcy remains a significant challenge, 
impacting numerous stakeholders and causing extensive social and financial ramifications. 
Traditional methods of bankruptcy prediction, relying mainly on manual analysis and qualitative judgment, 
have shown limited accuracy, necessitating an enhanced approach for better forecasting. Our research project presents a 
comprehensive machine-learning based framework designed to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of bankruptcy 
prediction using extensive financial data. Our dataset comprises over 78,000 financial institution-year pairs from NYSE and NASDAQ, 
spanning from 1999 to 2018, and includes 21 financial features per sample, which we supplement through feature engineering. 
We address the challenge of high dimensionality through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and correct class imbalance using 
the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), enhancing our model's ability to predict minority class events accurately. 
Our approach utilizes a variety of machine learning models, with a focus on boosted random forests for their strong performance and interpretability. 
Preliminary results suggest that our method not only improves on traditional prediction accuracies but also offers significant insights into the 
financial indicators most predictive of bankruptcy. This project aims to contribute to the existing literature by refining data preprocessing techniques and 
employing advanced machine learning strategies to better predict corporate bankruptcies, thereby potentially mitigating their adverse social and financial effects.
